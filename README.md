The project includes clean notebooks, visualizations, and results documentation.

📁 Key Components:

* `EDA.ipynb` — Insightful exploratory data analysis of customer behavior.
* `Clustering.ipynb` — Unsupervised learning for customer segmentation.
* `Lookalike.ipynb` — Predictive modeling to recommend similar products/customers.
* `Transactions.csv`, `Customers.csv`, `Products.csv` — Raw datasets used.
